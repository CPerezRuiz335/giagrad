.. py:function:: collapse(partial: numpy.typing.NDArray, p_shape: Tuple[int, Ellipsis])


.. py:class:: Add(*tensors)

   Bases: :py:obj:`giagrad.tensor.Context`

   Abstract class for all operators defined in mathops, reductionsops, etc
   An operator creates an instance of itself with class method forward that
   contains the parents of the Tensor created by Tensor.comm()

   Operators are just extensions of Tensor class to have Tensor functionality 
   self contained but separated in different files. 

   Attributes
   ----------
   parents: Tuple[Any, ...]
       operands/Tensors of the operator, can contain other values with Tensor.comm(.., **kwargs)


   .. py:method:: forward(t1, t2) -> Tuple[numpy.typing.NDArray, Add]
      :classmethod:

      Main function for forward pass.


   .. py:method:: backward(partial: numpy.typing.NDArray)

      Backprop automatic differentiation, to update grad of parents.
      partial: gradient of the output of forward method.
